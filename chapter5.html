      <h1>Chapter 5 - Fractures in the Glass</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Aya’s days began to fall into an uneasy rhythm. She’d paint during the mornings, her brush moving almost compulsively as if trying to untangle the knots in her chest, and spend her evenings wandering the town or meeting Yumi.</p>
      <p>Their conversations were always easy, filled with laughter and lingering glances, but there was something unspoken between them—a fragile tension that neither seemed willing to address. It hung in the air like the quiet after a storm, waiting to break.</p>
      <p>One afternoon, Aya decided to stop by the bookstore. It had become a habit, one she didn’t entirely understand but couldn’t resist. As she pushed open the door, the familiar bell jingled, and Yumi looked up from behind the counter.</p>
      <p>“Aya” she said, her smile warm but slightly distracted. “Hey.”</p>
      <p>Aya frowned as she stepped closer, noticing the furrow in Yumi’s brow. “You okay?”</p>
      <p>Yumi hesitated, her hands fiddling with a pen. “Yeah, just… my mom stopped by earlier.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s stomach twisted. She hadn’t heard much about Yumi’s mother, but what little Yumi had shared painted a picture of a woman with rigid expectations and a firm grip on her daughter’s life.</p>
      <p>“Everything okay?” Aya asked carefully.</p>
      <p>Yumi sighed, setting the pen down. “She’s been asking when I’m going to ‘settle down.’ You know, find a nice guy, start thinking about marriage.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s chest tightened, the words hitting her harder than she expected. She forced a casual tone. “And what did you tell her?”</p>
      <p>Yumi shrugged, her gaze dropping to the counter. “I told her I’m not ready for that. But you know how she is. She thinks I’m wasting my time working here and living on my own.”</p>
      <p>Aya leaned against the counter, trying to mask the sudden storm in her chest.</p>
      <p>“You’re not wasting your time, Yumi. You’re doing what makes you happy. That’s what matters.”</p>
      <p>Yumi looked up at her, a small, grateful smile on her lips.</p>
      <p>“Thanks, Aya. I just… sometimes I feel like I’ll never be enough for her.”</p>
      <p>“You are,” Aya said firmly, her voice steadier than she felt. “You’re more than enough.”</p>
      <p>For a moment, they simply looked at each other, the words between them charged with a meaning neither dared to name. Aya wanted to reach out, to offer something more than words, but the sound of the bell above the door startled them both.</p>
      <p>A man walked in, tall and well-dressed, with an air of confidence that immediately drew attention. He smiled at Yumi, his voice smooth as he greeted her.</p>
      <p>“Yumi, it’s been a while.”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s smile faltered, but she quickly recovered. “Tomo. Wow, it has been a while. How are you?”</p>
      <p>Aya froze, her mind racing. Tomo. The name felt like a ghost from their past, a boy who had been part of their trio before life pulled them in separate directions.</p>
      <p>“I’m good,” Tomo said, his smile easy.</p>
      <p>“I just got back in town. Thought I’d stop by and see how you were doing.”</p>
      <p>Yumi nodded, her posture relaxing slightly. “That’s great. Welcome back.”</p>
      <p>Aya felt like an outsider, standing there as Yumi and Tomo exchanged pleasantries. She forced a polite smile when Yumi introduced them, but her chest burned with an unfamiliar sensation as she watched the way Tomo looked at Yumi—warm, attentive, and far too familiar.</p>
      <p>“Maybe we could catch up sometime,” Tomo said, his gaze lingering on Yumi.</p>
      <p>“Sure,” Yumi replied, her tone polite but noncommittal.</p>
      <p>The exchange left a bitter taste in Aya’s mouth, and she excused herself soon after, mumbling something about needing to get back to her painting. Yumi watched her go, a flicker of confusion crossing her face, but Aya didn’t look back.</p>
      <p>Later that night, Aya sat in her room, staring at the half-finished painting on her easel. Her brush hovered over the canvas, but she couldn’t focus. All she could think about was Yumi’s smile, the sound of her laugh, and the way Tomo had stepped into the space between them as if he belonged there.</p>
      <p>She hated how petty she felt, how irrationally jealous. Yumi was her friend—nothing more. She had no right to feel this way. And yet, she couldn’t shake the ache in her chest, the gnawing fear that Tomo might take Yumi away from her in a way she never could.</p>
      <p>With a frustrated sigh, Aya set the brush down and leaned back in her chair. Her gaze drifted to the window, where the oak tree stood silhouetted against the night sky. It had always been their place, a sanctuary where promises were made and kept.</p>
      <p>But now, Aya wasn’t sure if that was enough.</p>
