      <h1>Chapter 8 - Shadows Between Us</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>The days after that rainy afternoon passed in a blur. Aya threw herself into her painting, hoping the rhythm of her brushstrokes would drown out the turmoil in her chest. But every time she closed her eyes, she saw Yumi—her smile, her laughter, the gentle way she tilted her head when she was curious.</p>
      <p>And, inevitably, she saw Tomo, his presence a shadow that Aya couldn’t escape.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until the weekend that Yumi called, her voice bright and insistent.</p>
      <p>“You’re coming with me today,” she said, offering no room for argument.</p>
      <p>Aya frowned, adjusting her glasses. “Where?”</p>
      <p>“You’ll see,” Yumi said with a teasing lilt. “Be ready in thirty minutes.”</p>
      <p>Aya barely had time to grab her sketchbook before Yumi arrived, her energy infectious despite Aya’s reluctance. As they walked through town, Aya realized they were heading toward the outskirts—their old neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Her chest tightened as they approached the oak tree. It stood tall and proud, its branches now bare with the approach of winter. Aya felt a pang of nostalgia, the sight of it stirring memories she’d tried to bury.</p>
      <p>“You’re quiet,” Yumi said, glancing at her.</p>
      <p>Aya shrugged, her fingers clutching the strap of her bag. “Just… thinking.”</p>
      <p>Yumi stopped under the tree, her gaze thoughtful. “Do you remember the last time we came here? Before you moved away?”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her throat tight. “How could I forget?”</p>
      <p>“We made a promise,” Yumi said softly, her fingers brushing the bark of the tree.</p>
      <p>“I used to come here all the time, wondering if you’d remember. If you’d ever come back.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s heart ached at the vulnerability in Yumi’s voice. “I never forgot,” she said, her voice steady despite the emotions threatening to overwhelm her. “I always planned to come back. I just… didn’t know how.”</p>
      <p>Yumi turned to her, her eyes searching Aya’s face. “Why did you leave, Aya? You never told me.”</p>
      <p>Aya froze, the question catching her off guard. She looked away, her hands tightening into fists. </p>
      <p>“It wasn’t my choice,” she said after a moment.</p>
      <p>“My dad wanted a fresh start, and I didn’t have a say. But I hated it. I hated being so far from you.”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s expression softened, but there was a flicker of something else—hurt, maybe?—in her eyes. “You could’ve written. Called. Anything.”</p>
      <p>“I know,” Aya said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I should have. But I was scared.”</p>
      <p>“Scared of what?”</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, the words on the tip of her tongue. She wanted to tell Yumi everything—the fear, the longing, the feelings she’d kept buried for years. But the weight of those emotions felt too heavy, too dangerous.</p>
      <p>“Of losing you,” she said finally, her voice trembling.</p>
      <p>Yumi stepped closer, her gaze unwavering. “You didn’t lose me, Aya. I’m still here.”</p>
      <p>The honesty in her voice made Aya’s chest tighten. She wanted to believe it, but the shadow of Tomo loomed large in her mind.</p>
      <p>Before she could respond, a familiar voice called out.</p>
      <p>“Yumi! Aya!”</p>
      <p>They turned to see Tomo approaching, a bag slung over his shoulder and a wide grin on his face. Aya’s heart sank, the moment shattered.</p>
      <p>“What are you two doing out here?” Tomo asked, his tone light and easy.</p>
      <p>“Just reminiscing,” Yumi said, her smile polite but strained.</p>
      <p>Tomo nodded, his gaze flickering between them. “I was heading to the café. Thought I’d grab a bite and see if you wanted to join me.”</p>
      <p>Aya felt the question hanging in the air, unspoken but clear. Yumi hesitated, her eyes darting to Aya.</p>
      <p>“Actually,” Yumi said after a moment, “Aya and I were just about to head to the park. Maybe another time?”</p>
      <p>Aya blinked, surprised by the sudden shift. Tomo looked equally taken aback but nodded with a good-natured smile. </p>
      <p>“Sure. Another time.”</p>
      <p>As he walked away, Yumi turned back to Aya, her expression unreadable.</p>
      <p>“Come on. Let’s go.”</p>
      <p>They walked in silence, the weight of the interrupted moment lingering between them. When they reached the park, Yumi sat on a bench, her gaze distant.</p>
      <p>“Why didn’t you say anything?” Yumi asked suddenly.</p>
      <p>Aya frowned, sitting beside her. “About what?”</p>
      <p>“About Tomo” Yumi said, her voice quiet. “I can see it bothers you. So why won’t you talk to me about it?”</p>
      <p>Aya’s stomach twisted, the words bubbling to the surface before she could stop them. </p>
      <p>"Because it’s not my place. You’re free to be with whoever you want.”</p>
      <p>Yumi turned to her, her eyes filled with a mix of frustration and something Aya couldn’t name.</p>
      <p>“Aya… it’s not about who I’m with. It’s about you. I want to know what you’re thinking, what you’re feeling.”</p>
      <p>Aya looked away, her hands gripping the edge of the bench. “It doesn’t matter.”</p>
      <p>“It does to me,” Yumi said firmly, her voice steady despite the tension in her tone.</p>
      <p>Aya’s heart pounded, the unspoken truth threatening to spill over. But she couldn’t bring herself to say it, to risk the delicate balance between them.</p>
      <p>Instead, she stood, her voice tight. “I need to go.”</p>
      <p>Yumi didn’t stop her, but the silence that followed felt heavier than any words could have been.</p>
      <p>As Aya walked away, the weight of her unspoken feelings pressed down on her, suffocating in its intensity.</p>
      <p>And for the first time, she wondered if she was strong enough to keep carrying them alone.</p>
