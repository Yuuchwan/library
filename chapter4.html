      <h1>Chapter 4 - Ghosts of Promise</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Aya stared at her canvas, the colors smeared across it like an unfinished thought. She’d hoped coming back to this town would inspire her, but instead, she felt restless. Memories clung to her like stubborn shadows, making it impossible to focus.</p>
      <p>She tossed the brush onto the table and sighed. Her father’s house was quiet, too quiet, and the walls seemed to close in on her. Grabbing her coat, she stepped outside, letting the crisp evening air fill her lungs. She didn’t have a destination in mind, but her feet seemed to know where they were going.</p>
      <p>The oak tree stood as it always had, its silhouette dark against the fading light. Aya leaned against its trunk, the bark rough beneath her palms. She closed her eyes and let the memories wash over her—their laughter, their whispered secrets, and that pinky promise made so many years ago.</p>
      <p>She didn’t know how long she stood there, lost in thought, before a familiar voice broke the silence.</p>
      <p>“Couldn’t stay away, huh?”</p>
      <p>Aya turned to see Yumi approaching, her figure framed by the dim glow of the streetlights. She wore a soft smile, her hands tucked into the pockets of her coat.</p>
      <p>Aya managed a chuckle. “I guess not. It feels like this tree’s been waiting for us or something.”</p>
      <p>Yumi stopped a few steps away, her gaze drifting to the branches above.</p>
      <p>“It does feel that way, doesn’t it? Like no matter how much changes, this place stays the same.”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, the ache in her chest both comforting and bittersweet.</p>
      <p>“Do you ever think about that promise we made?”</p>
      <p>Yumi hesitated, her expression thoughtful. “I think about it more than I probably should.”</p>
      <p>“Why?” Aya asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
      <p>Yumi glanced at her, a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes.</p>
      <p>“Because it reminds me of who we used to be. And sometimes I wonder if I’ve lost that part of myself.”</p>
      <p>Aya felt her breath catch. She wanted to tell Yumi she hadn’t changed, that the girl Aya had known was still there, but the words felt too heavy to say aloud.</p>
      <p>Instead, she said, “I think we’ve both changed. But maybe that’s not a bad thing.”</p>
      <p>Yumi smiled faintly, her gaze softening. “Maybe not.”</p>
      <p>They stood in silence for a while, the quiet settling around them like a blanket. Aya found herself stealing glances at Yumi, the faint light casting shadows across her face. She looked serene, but there was a tension in her posture, as if she were holding something back.</p>
      <p>“Why did you really come back, Aya?” Yumi asked suddenly, her voice breaking the stillness.</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, caught off guard by the question. She opened her mouth to answer, but the truth felt too raw, too complicated to put into words. </p>
      <p>“I’m not sure,” she said finally. “I guess… I wanted to find something I’d lost.”</p>
      <p>Yumi tilted her head, her gaze searching. “And have you?”</p>
      <p>Aya looked away, her heart pounding in her chest. “I don’t know. Maybe.”</p>
      <p>The words hung in the air between them, heavy with meaning. Aya wasn’t sure if Yumi understood what she meant—if even Aya understood what she meant—but the look in Yumi’s eyes told her she wasn’t alone in her confusion.</p>
      <p>“Come on,” Yumi said gently, breaking the moment. “It’s getting late. Let me walk you home.”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her throat too tight to speak. As they walked side by side through the quiet streets, she couldn’t help but feel that they were both searching for something, something they might only find in each other.</p>
      <p>When they reached her father’s house, Yumi stopped at the gate, her hands buried deep in her pockets. </p>
      <p>“Goodnight, Aya,” she said softly.</p>
      <p>“Goodnight,” Aya replied, her voice barely audible.</p>
      <p>She watched Yumi walk away, her figure fading into the darkness, and felt a pang of longing she couldn’t ignore. Turning toward the house, Aya knew sleep would be elusive that night.</p>
      <p>Inside, she sat at her desk and stared at the blank canvas again. But this time, the image in her mind was clear: two figures standing beneath an oak tree, their lives intertwined by a promise that had never truly been broken.</p>
      <p>And for the first time in years, Aya picked up her brush and began to paint.</p>
