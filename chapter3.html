      <h1>Chapter 3 - Threads of the Past</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Aya spent the next few days trying to settle into a routine, but the familiarity of the town made it impossible to avoid the memories. Everywhere she turned, something reminded her of Yumi—of the days they had spent biking along the quiet streets, the lazy afternoons spent under the oak tree, and the way Yumi had always smiled as if she were holding a secret only Aya was meant to understand.</p>
      <p>It didn’t help that Yumi seemed to appear in her life more often now, as if fate was pulling them together. Aya found herself stopping by the bookstore more frequently, sometimes under the pretense of buying a book she didn’t need, other times just to say hello.</p>
      <p>Each visit felt like a step back into something familiar, yet entirely new. They talked about books, about the town, about the little things that didn’t matter much but felt like pieces of a larger puzzle. Aya wasn’t sure what she was looking for in those conversations, but she knew she didn’t want them to end.</p>
      <p>One evening, as the sun dipped low in the sky, Aya found herself lingering outside the bookstore again. Through the glass, she could see Yumi closing up, her movements slow and deliberate. Aya hesitated, her hand hovering over the door handle. She hadn’t planned to stop by tonight, but her feet had carried her here anyway.</p>
      <p>Before she could decide, Yumi glanced up and caught her eye. A smile spread across her face, and she waved Aya in.</p>
      <p>“You’re here late,” Yumi said as Aya stepped inside, her voice warm despite the long day she must have had.</p>
      <p>“Sorry,” Aya replied, brushing a hand through her hair. “I was just… passing by.”</p>
      <p>Yumi chuckled softly, leaning against the counter. “You seem to pass by a lot lately.”</p>
      <p>Aya felt a flush rise to her cheeks. “I guess I’ve missed this place more than I thought.”</p>
      <p>Yumi didn’t respond immediately. Instead, she looked at Aya with a quiet intensity, her eyes searching hers for something unspoken. </p>
      <p>Finally, she said, “It’s nice having you back. I didn’t realize how much I missed talking to you.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s chest tightened. There was something in Yumi’s tone—something vulnerable, almost fragile.</p>
      <p>“I missed it too,” Aya admitted, her voice softer.</p>
      <p>For a moment, neither of them spoke. The only sound was the soft ticking of the clock on the wall and the faint hum of the street outside.</p>
      <p>“Do you want to grab dinner?” Yumi asked suddenly, her voice cutting through the quiet.</p>
      <p>“There’s a little place down the street. It’s nothing fancy, but it’s good.”</p>
      <p>Aya blinked, surprised by the offer, but she nodded. “Yeah. I’d like that.”</p>
      <p>They walked to the small diner together, the air between them easy and companionable. The restaurant was modest but cozy, its tables adorned with checkered tablecloths and small vases of wildflowers. They slid into a booth by the window, and for the first time in years, Aya felt like she was home.</p>
      <p>As they ate, the conversation flowed effortlessly. They reminisced about their childhoods, laughing over shared memories and filling in the gaps of the years they’d missed. But as the laughter faded, the conversation took on a more serious tone.</p>
      <p>“Do you ever think about what might’ve happened if we’d stayed in touch?” Yumi asked, her eyes fixed on her drink.</p>
      <p>Aya paused, her fork hovering mid-air. “All the time,” she admitted. “But I guess life just… got in the way.”</p>
      <p>Yumi nodded, her expression thoughtful.</p>
      <p>“I used to be angry about it. Not at you—just… at how easily things fell apart.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s chest ached at the confession. She set her fork down, her appetite suddenly gone.</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry,” she said quietly. “I never meant to—”</p>
      <p>“I know,” Yumi interrupted gently, her eyes meeting Aya’s. </p>
      <p>“I know you didn’t. I just… I guess I always wondered if I should’ve tried harder to keep us close.”</p>
      <p>Aya looked down at her hands, her heart heavy. “Maybe we both should have.”</p>
      <p>The silence that followed was heavy but not uncomfortable. It was the kind of silence that spoke volumes, that said the things neither of them could put into words.</p>
      <p>After a while, Yumi smiled faintly and changed the subject, steering the conversation back to lighter topics. But Aya couldn’t stop thinking about Yumi’s words, about the quiet longing in her voice.</p>
      <p>When they left the diner, the streets were quiet, the stars bright against the dark sky. They walked side by side, their steps slow as if neither of them wanted the night to end.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for dinner,” Aya said as they reached the bookstore.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for saying yes,” Yumi replied, her smile soft.</p>
      <p>They stood there for a moment, neither of them moving. The streetlights cast a warm glow around them, and Aya found herself studying Yumi’s face—the gentle curve of her smile, the way her hair fell across her shoulder.</p>
      <p>“I’ll see you tomorrow?” Yumi asked, her voice light but hopeful.</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her heart full and heavy all at once. “Yeah. Tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>As she walked away, Aya couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted between them. It was subtle, like the first hint of spring after a long winter, but it was there.</p>
      <p>And for the first time in years, Aya felt like maybe—just maybe—they were finding their way back to each other.</p>
