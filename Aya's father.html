      <h1>Aya's Father</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Aya’s father, Hiroshi, came from a small, close-knit family. His parents had passed away when he was young, and he was left to navigate the world alone. This sense of solitude carried through into his adult life. After marrying Haruka, he often buried himself in work as a way to avoid confronting his own vulnerabilities. Hiroshi had loved his wife deeply, but he struggled to express it, especially after the pressures of providing for their family grew heavier.</p>
      <p>When Aya was born, Hiroshi was determined to give her a better life than his own childhood. But his emotional distance only grew as Aya entered adolescence, and he became too absorbed in work to notice the widening gap between them. His own fears of abandonment had shaped how he interacted with his family—by keeping them at arm’s length, he thought he could prevent the hurt he’d experienced from losing his own parents.</p>
      <p>Hiroshi’s acceptance of Aya’s relationship with Yumi was slow. At first, he tried to ignore it, telling himself that it was just a phase, a friendship. But as Aya’s emotions became clearer, Hiroshi was forced to confront his own biases. While he had never been outwardly hostile toward LGBTQ+ individuals, he still struggled with how his own daughter’s life choices clashed with his traditional upbringing. Over time, however, he began to see the depth of their connection, realizing that he had spent so many years pushing Aya away when all she needed was his support. His journey mirrored Aya’s—slow and painful, but ultimately leading toward a more open understanding of love and family.</p>
