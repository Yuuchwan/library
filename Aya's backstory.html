      <h1>Aya's backstory</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Aya grew up in a family that moved frequently, a consequence of her father’s job that required constant relocations. Her father, Hiroshi, was a practical man, focusing on survival and stability rather than emotional closeness. Aya’s mother, Haruka, was more emotionally present, but as the years wore on, she became increasingly overwhelmed by the demands of raising a family in constant flux. Aya always felt torn between them—her mother tried to hold things together, while her father kept his distance, burying his own feelings under work. This emotional divide created a silent gap in their relationship, one that Aya never fully understood until much later.
      </p>
      <p>Aya's love for painting developed early as an escape. When her parents’ emotional distance became too much, she would retreat into her art. The art world, however, was seen as an impractical pursuit by her father, who had always hoped Aya would follow a more “pragmatic” career path. This constant push and pull between what Aya wanted and what her father expected created a sense of quiet rebellion in her, though it was always masked by her calm exterior.</p>
      <p>Yumi had always been the anchor in Aya’s life. From the first day they met under the tree, Yumi had offered Aya the stability that her family couldn’t. As children, they shared everything—their dreams, fears, and quiet moments. Aya never realized it at the time, but their friendship was more than just that; it was the only time she truly felt understood. When they were separated, Aya never stopped thinking about Yumi, even as she tried to bury those feelings beneath layers of distance and time. The connection they shared was one Aya couldn’t replicate with anyone else, and it lingered in the back of her mind through all her artistic endeavors.</p>
