      <h1>Yumi's Backstory</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Yumi grew up in a household dominated by traditional values, where success was measured by how well she conformed to societal expectations. Her mother, Keiko, was a stern, demanding woman who had always envisioned a future where Yumi married a successful man, had children, and became a pillar of the family. Yumi’s father, though kind, deferred to his wife, making it clear that Yumi’s happiness would come second to family obligations.</p>
      <p>This created a quiet rebellion in Yumi. She began to question her role in the world, particularly when it came to her own desires. She never had the courage to act on her feelings for Aya back when they were children, but those feelings had always remained, even after their separation. During her teenage years, Yumi dated a few boys—people who fit the mold of what her mother would approve of—but deep down, she never felt the way she was “supposed” to feel. Her internal battle between her family’s expectations and her own growing awareness of her feelings toward women was an unspoken burden she carried alone.</p>
      <p>After reconnecting with Aya as an adult, Yumi found herself back at square one. Her feelings for Aya were undeniable, but the weight of her family’s expectations and her fear of disappointing them held her back. She began dating Tomo, a kind but conventional man, as a way to placate her mother. Tomo was everything her family wanted—respectable, well-educated, and well-meaning. But he never saw the true Yumi, the one who longed for something more, something she wasn’t sure how to define.</p>
      <p>Yumi’s journey became one of self-discovery, caught between her love for Aya and the guilt she felt for not living up to her family’s ideal. At the same time, she found herself questioning who she really was, outside of the labels her family had given her. As she spent more time with Aya, Yumi started to understand that the answer didn’t lie in choosing between her past and her feelings—it was about accepting both parts of herself and learning to balance them.</p>
