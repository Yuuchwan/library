     <h1>Chapter 10 - The Weight of Blossoms</h1> <hr>
     <p>Winter lingered in the air, but the cold didn’t reach Aya as she walked through the familiar streets. Her hands were shoved deep into her coat pockets, her breath visible in the crisp evening air. She was heading to the park—the oak tree’s silhouette against the twilight sky pulling her like a magnet.</p>
     <p>Yumi had asked her to meet there, her voice quiet but certain when she called earlier. Aya didn’t ask why; she hadn’t dared.</p>
     <p>When Aya arrived, she found Yumi already there, standing beneath the tree. She was bundled in a long scarf, her hands tucked into her sleeves. The sight of her sent a familiar ache through Aya’s chest.</p>
     <p>“Hey,” Aya said softly, stepping closer.</p>
     <p>Yumi turned, her lips curving into a faint smile. “Hey.”</p>
     <p>For a moment, neither of them spoke. The silence between them was heavy, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It felt like they were standing on the edge of something vast, something fragile.</p>
     <p>“I’ve been thinking a lot,” Yumi began, her voice steady but tinged with uncertainty.</p>
     <p>Aya’s chest tightened. She nodded, waiting.</p>
     <p>Yumi glanced up at the bare branches above them, her expression thoughtful.</p>
     <p>“I remember when we made that promise. I thought it was just something kids said, you know? But I kept coming back here. Even when I thought you’d forgotten, I kept coming.”</p>
     <p>“I never forgot,” Aya said, her voice trembling.</p>
     <p>Yumi looked at her, her eyes searching. “I don’t know if I’m ready for this, Aya. For what you told me.”</p>
     <p>Aya swallowed hard, her heart sinking. She nodded, forcing herself to stay calm.</p>
     <p>“It’s okay. I just needed you to know. I don’t want you to feel pressured.”</p>
     <p>Yumi shook her head, a wry smile tugging at her lips. “You’re always thinking about me, aren’t you?”</p>
     <p>Aya blinked, caught off guard. “Of course I am.”</p>
     <p>“That’s the thing,” Yumi said, stepping closer. “You’ve always been there for me, even when I didn’t realize it. And now… now I don’t know what to do with that.”</p>
     <p>Aya hesitated, her heart pounding. “Yumi, I don’t need an answer. I don’t need anything. Just having you in my life is enough.”</p>
     <p>Yumi’s expression softened, and for a moment, she looked like the girl Aya had known all those years ago. </p>
     <p>“You’ve always been so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, you knew what you wanted. I envied that.”</p>
     <p>I’m not as sure as you think,” Aya said, her voice barely above a whisper. “But I know how I feel about you. That’s the only thing I’ve ever been certain of.”</p>
     <p>Yumi looked away, her gaze fixed on the ground. “It’s not that simple for me. I’m still figuring things out—about myself, about what I want. And it scares me.”</p>
     <p>Aya reached out, hesitating for a moment before resting her hand on Yumi’s shoulder. “I’ll wait. As long as it takes, I’ll wait for you.”</p>
     <p>Yumi’s eyes met hers, shimmering with unshed tears. “You’re so stubborn,” she said, her voice breaking with a faint laugh.</p>
     <p>Aya smiled, the ache in her chest easing just slightly. “I learned from the best.”</p>
     <p>They stood there, the silence stretching between them like an unspoken promise. The stars began to emerge, their light flickering against the darkening sky.</p>
     <p>After a while, Yumi spoke again, her voice quiet but firm. “I don’t know if I can ever give you what you want, Aya. But I want to try. I want to figure it out—with you.”</p>
     <p>Aya felt her breath catch, her heart pounding in her ears. She nodded, her voice trembling. “That’s all I could ever ask for.”</p>
     <p>Yumi stepped closer, her hand brushing against Aya’s. For a moment, they stood there, their fingers barely touching, the space between them charged with unspoken emotion.</p>
     <p>The world around them seemed to fade, the cold forgotten as they stood beneath the tree that had witnessed their past, their present, and now their uncertain future.</p>
     <p>As the first snowflakes began to fall, Aya felt a fragile hope bloom in her chest—a hope that, like the blossoms of spring, could withstand the harshest winter.</p>
     <p>-------------------------</p>
     <p>Months later, as the first hints of spring began to touch the world, Aya stood in a gallery, her painting of the cherry tree displayed prominently on the wall. The figures beneath it were no longer unfinished; they were whole, vibrant, and unmistakably her and Yumi.</p>
     <p>She felt a presence beside her and turned to see Yumi, her expression a mix of awe and quiet pride.</p>
     <p>“It’s beautiful,” Yumi said softly, her gaze lingering on the painting.</p>
     <p>Aya smiled, her heart full. “So are you.”</p>
     <p>They didn’t need words to fill the space between them. Their journey was far from over, but for now, they had each other.</p>
     <p>And that was enough.</p>
