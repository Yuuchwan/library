      <h1>Yumi's POV </h1>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>Yumi is a woman caught between two worlds. On one hand, she is still shaped by the rigid, traditional values of her family, and on the other, she has an undeniable attraction to Aya that she can no longer ignore. Throughout the story, Yumi’s POV reflects her internal turmoil—she longs for Aya but feels trapped by the expectations placed on her by society and her family. Her love for Aya is a slow-burn realization, one she keeps hidden for a long time due to fear, guilt, and confusion.</strong></p>
      <p>When she and Aya make their promise under the tree, Yumi feels a sense of security and certainty in that moment. It’s a promise that feels unbreakable, even though she’s too young to understand what it might mean. The simplicity of the moment stands in stark contrast to her more complex feelings now. Looking back, Yumi sees that promise as a moment where she unknowingly planted the seeds of her love for Aya.</p>
      <p>Even though Yumi doesn’t fully realize it yet, this moment represents a deeper connection that has always existed between them, one that only time would reveal. Yumi’s reflection on this event as an adult is bittersweet; she knows that life and time have changed them both, but a part of her holds onto that naive hope that one day they could fulfill that promise.</p>
      <p>During the years of separation, Yumi experiences a deep sense of loss. Although her life moves forward—she goes to school, makes friends, and dates men—nothing feels right. No relationship compares to the bond she had with Aya, and it haunts her quietly. She often wonders what Aya is doing, whether she’s thinking of her, and if Aya remembers their promise. Yumi’s POV during this time reflects her yearning and confusion.</p>
      <p>She never fully understood why they were separated, why Aya’s family moved away without a word. The loss of Aya is a wound that never heals, and even though Yumi tries to bury it, the feeling of abandonment always lingers beneath the surface. There’s an emptiness that only Aya could fill, and it’s something Yumi never fully lets go of. The chapters here would focus on Yumi’s internal voice, full of longing, self-doubt, and a sense of helplessness.</p>
      <p>When Yumi reunites with Aya, it’s a flood of emotions. There’s joy, relief, and an overwhelming sense of nostalgia, but also a deep fear. Yumi is aware that the person standing before her is both familiar and foreign. Aya has changed, as has she, and there’s an uncomfortable gap between them now. At the same time, Yumi can’t ignore the pull she still feels for Aya.</p>
      <p>She tries to act as though everything is fine, even though every part of her wants to reach out and close the distance. The memories of their childhood friendship come rushing back, and she feels the weight of their past promise, but she’s unsure how to move forward. Yumi is aware of how different their lives are now, and the idea of rekindling their connection feels both exhilarating and terrifying. She’s not sure if she’s ready to face the unresolved feelings she has for Aya.</p>
      <p>Her internal dialogue reveals her desire to be close to Aya, but also the confusion of seeing her as someone more than just a friend. Yumi is afraid of what it means to feel this way and whether it’s okay for her to acknowledge it. She wants to hold on to their friendship, but at the same time, she feels the pull of something more.</p>
      <p>She’s aware of her feelings for Aya but is unable to fully confront them. Her life is complicated by her ongoing relationship with Tomo, whom she doesn’t feel the same way about, but whom she stays with to fulfill her mother’s expectations. Yumi feels a constant tug of war between what she wants—Aya—and what her family wants for her. She knows her mother would never approve of a relationship with another woman, and the thought of disappointing her family fills her with guilt.</p>
      <p>She wants to be honest with herself, but there are so many forces holding her back. Tomo’s presence in her life feels like a compromise, and Yumi wonders whether she’s doing it for the right reasons. Her feelings for Aya only make her feel more lost, as though she’s living a double life.</p>
      <p>Her guilt about not being true to herself weighs heavily on her. She starts questioning whether she’s being unfair to Tomo, to herself, and to Aya. The pressure to fit into a mold she didn’t choose is suffocating, and she finds herself resenting the roles she’s been assigned.</p>
      <p>Her feelings for Aya are undeniable, but she’s still too afraid to voice them. She struggles with the concept of identity—her sexual identity, her role in her family, and what it means to be loved for who she truly is. Yumi realizes that her family’s traditional views don’t align with her own growing understanding of herself. She feels caught in a trap of societal expectations, unable to break free from the life path her family has laid out for her.
    </p>
      <p>She wishes she could tell Aya how she feels, but the fear of rejection and the pressure of family expectations paralyze her. She’s also afraid of what it might mean for their friendship. What if confessing ruins everything? What if Aya doesn’t feel the same way?</p>
      <p>At the same time, Yumi can’t ignore the connection between them. Her thoughts often return to the way Aya looks at her, the way they laugh together, the way Aya’s presence feels like home. There’s an overwhelming longing for something more, but Yumi feels like she’s not allowed to have it.</p>
      <p> The realization that she’s in love with Aya finally hits her—there’s no denying it any longer. Her internal monologue is chaotic, filled with self-doubt and confusion. She’s terrified of what this means for their relationship and the consequences it might have on her life. She wonders if it’s too late to tell Aya, if she’s already missed her chance.</p>
      <p>But there’s also a deep yearning to be honest with herself and with Aya. Yumi has spent so long suppressing her feelings, pretending they don’t exist, but she’s tired of living in fear. She starts to imagine what it would be like to be with Aya openly, without the weight of societal expectations hanging over her. The idea both terrifies and excites her. Yumi is at a crossroads, unsure of whether to take the risk or stay in the safety of the life she’s built so far.</p>
      <p>Yumi begins to accept her feelings for Aya, even if she’s still too afraid to voice them. Her internal journey is one of self-acceptance—she begins to realize that she can’t keep living for her family’s expectations. She deserves to live authentically, even if it means stepping into the unknown.</p>
      <p>She starts to become more comfortable with the idea of loving Aya, even if she can’t yet fully act on it. She begins to see the possibility of a future where she’s not hiding her true self from the world. There’s a quiet sense of peace as she begins to accept that love isn’t always easy or clear-cut, but it’s real and worth fighting for.</p>
      <p> She accepts that her love for Aya is an essential part of who she is, and that it’s okay to love someone who is her closest friend. Yumi’s journey is one of quiet strength—she doesn’t need a grand confession to understand the depth of their bond.

        She finds peace in the connection they share, no matter how unspoken. She learns that sometimes, love doesn’t need to be declared—it simply exists in the moments they share, in the way they support each other, and in the trust that binds them together.</p>
