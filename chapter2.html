      <h1>Chapter 2 - Beneath Familiar Skies</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Aya found herself wandering through the old town the next morning, her steps carrying her almost instinctively toward the park. She didn’t know why she’d come—perhaps to chase ghosts of the past, or maybe to confront the feelings she thought she had buried years ago.</p>
      <p>The park was nearly empty, save for a few joggers and an elderly couple feeding the ducks by the pond. Aya’s gaze traveled across the familiar landscape until it landed on the oak tree.</p>
      <p>It still stood proud and towering, its branches stretching wide against the sky. She walked toward it slowly, her heart heavy with memories. She could almost hear their voices echoing in the air—the laughter, the whispered secrets, and that solemn promise made under its blossoms.</p>
      <p>Aya ran her hand along the bark, feeling the rough texture beneath her fingers. Time had worn grooves into the tree, just as it had worn grooves into her life. She wondered if Yumi ever came here anymore or if she had let those memories fade.</p>
      <p>“Aya?”</p>
      <p>The sound of her name startled her, and she turned to see Yumi standing a few steps away. She wasn’t sure what surprised her more—the fact that Yumi was here, or the soft, almost shy expression on her face.</p>
      <p>“You always did like this tree,” Yumi said, stepping closer.</p>
      <p>Aya felt her chest tighten, unsure of what to say. “I guess I couldn’t stay away.”</p>
      <p>Yumi smiled faintly, her hands tucked into the pockets of her coat. “I haven’t been here in years.”</p>
      <p>Aya glanced up at the branches, her voice quieter now. “Do you remember the last time we were here?”</p>
      <p>Yumi nodded, her gaze following Aya’s. “How could I forget? We made a promise.”</p>
      <p>“To meet here again,” Aya finished for her, her throat tightening. “When we were older.”</p>
      <p>Silence stretched between them, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It was heavy with things unsaid, with memories that felt too big to put into words.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t sure you’d remember,” Yumi admitted softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
      <p>Aya’s gaze flicked to her, and for a moment, she saw the girl Yumi used to be—the one who always hesitated before speaking, as if weighing the importance of her words. </p>
      <p>“I think about it all the time,” Aya said. “About us. About this place.”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s lips parted slightly, her expression unreadable. “I do too.”</p>
      <p>They stood there, the wind brushing past them and rustling the branches of the cherry tree. It was as if the world had paused, holding them in this moment together.</p>
      <p>Finally, Yumi broke the silence. “Do you want to walk for a bit? Around the park?”</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah, I’d like that.”</p>
      <p>They fell into step together, their pace slow as they followed the winding paths through the park. At first, they spoke of simple things—the town, Yumi’s work, Aya’s travels—but gradually, the conversation deepened.</p>
      <p>“You’ve seen so much of the world,” Yumi said, her voice tinged with both awe and wistfulness. </p>
      <p>“I can’t imagine what that’s like.”</p>
      <p>“It’s not as glamorous as it sounds,” Aya replied. </p>
      <p>“Sometimes it feels like I’m just running from one place to the next, trying to… I don’t know. Trying to figure out what I’m looking for.”</p>
      <p>Yumi glanced at her, a small crease forming between her brows.</p>
      <p>“And have you found it?”</p>
      <p>Aya shook her head, a bitter smile tugging at her lips. </p>
      <p>“Not yet. Maybe I’m not even sure what it is I’m looking for.”</p>
      <p>Yumi didn’t say anything at first, her gaze fixed on the path ahead. Then, almost hesitantly, she said, “Maybe it’s not about finding something. Maybe it’s about realizing what you already have.”</p>
      <p>Aya stopped walking, the words hitting her harder than she expected. “What do you mean?”</p>
      <p>Yumi turned to face her, her expression soft but steady. </p>
      <p>“Sometimes, we’re so busy searching for something new that we forget to appreciate what’s been with us all along.”</p>
      <p>The words hung in the air between them, and for a moment, Aya didn’t know how to respond. She wanted to ask Yumi if she was talking about the town. About their friendship. About them. But the words wouldn’t come.</p>
      <p>Instead, she nodded slowly, her chest feeling strangely tight. </p>
      <p>“Maybe you’re right.”</p>
      <p>They continued walking, the conversation easing back into lighter territory, but Aya couldn’t shake Yumi’s words. They clung to her like the scent of the blossoms that used to surround the oak tree—sweet, fleeting, and impossible to ignore.</p>
      <p>When they finally parted ways at the park entrance, Aya felt an ache she couldn’t quite name. She watched Yumi walk away, her figure growing smaller in the distance, and realized that coming back here wasn’t just about revisiting her past.</p>
      <p>It was about facing the part of her heart she had left behind.</p>
