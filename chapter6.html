      <h1>Chapter 6 - Ripples in still Water</h1> <hr>
      <p>Aya avoided the bookstore for days. She told herself it wasn’t deliberate, that she was busy with her painting, that she needed time to herself. But deep down, she knew she was running.</p>
      <p>Running from the way Tomo had looked at Yumi. Running from the realization that her feelings for Yumi weren’t as simple as she’d tried to convince herself they were.</p>
      <p>She buried herself in her work, the canvas slowly coming to life under her hands. The painting of the oak tree was nearly finished, but it felt like something was missing. No matter how many hours she spent adding details, it refused to feel complete.</p>
      <p>Her thoughts kept drifting back to Yumi—her smile, her laugh, the way her presence always seemed to fill the empty spaces in Aya’s life. But those thoughts inevitably brought Tomo with them, and Aya’s chest tightened every time she imagined them together.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until the end of the week that Yumi came to her. Aya was sitting in the small café near her father’s house, sketchbook open but untouched, when Yumi slid into the seat across from her.</p>
      <p>“You’ve been avoiding me,” Yumi said, her tone light but her eyes sharp.</p>
      <p>Aya blinked, caught off guard. “I haven’t—”</p>
      <p>Yumi raised an eyebrow, cutting her off. “Aya, you haven’t stopped by the store all week. That’s not like you.”</p>
      <p>Aya looked down at her sketchbook, unable to meet Yumi’s gaze. “I’ve been busy.”</p>
      <p>“Busy avoiding me?” Yumi pressed, her voice quieter now, tinged with something Aya couldn’t quite place.</p>
      <p>Aya sighed, leaning back in her chair. “It’s not like that.”</p>
      <p>“Then what is it?” Yumi asked, her eyes searching Aya’s face.</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, the words tangled in her throat. She wanted to tell Yumi the truth, to explain the storm of emotions she didn’t fully understand herself. But the thought of saying those words aloud, of risking the fragile balance between them, was too much.</p>
      <p>“It’s nothing,” Aya said finally, forcing a small smile. “I’ve just been in my head a lot lately. You know how I get.”</p>
      <p>Yumi didn’t look convinced, but she let it go with a sigh. “Okay. But if something’s bothering you, you can talk to me. You know that, right?”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her chest aching. “I know.”</p>
      <p>The conversation shifted after that, and Aya found herself relaxing despite the weight in her chest. Yumi had that effect on her—pulling her out of her head and grounding her in the present.</p>
      <p>They spent the rest of the afternoon together, wandering through the town and catching up on the little things they’d missed during Aya’s self-imposed isolation. Aya felt herself falling back into the rhythm of their friendship, the tension between them easing like the tide retreating from the shore.</p>
      <p>But the reprieve didn’t last.</p>
      <p>As they turned a corner, Aya froze. Across the street, Tomo was standing outside a café, talking animatedly with another man. He spotted them almost immediately and waved, his face lighting up as he crossed the street.</p>
      <p>“Yumi! Aya! Fancy seeing you two here.”</p>
      <p>Aya forced a polite smile, her heart sinking. “Hey, Tomo.”</p>
      <p>He turned to Yumi, his grin widening. “I was just about to call you. Are you free tonight? I was thinking we could grab dinner.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s stomach twisted, and she quickly looked away, pretending to study the shop window beside them.</p>
      <p>Yumi hesitated, glancing at Aya before answering. “Actually, I promised Aya we’d hang out tonight. Maybe another time?”</p>
      <p>Aya’s head snapped toward Yumi, her chest tightening with a confusing mix of relief and guilt. She hadn’t made any such plans with Yumi, and from the look on Tomo’s face, he knew it too.</p>
      <p>“Of course,” Tomo said after a moment, his smile faltering slightly. “I’ll see you around, then.”</p>
      <p>As he walked away, Yumi turned to Aya, her expression unreadable. “I hope you don’t mind. I just… didn’t feel like going.”</p>
      <p>Aya shook her head, her voice barely audible. “No, I don’t mind.”</p>
      <p>They walked in silence for a while, the air between them heavy. Aya wanted to ask Yumi why she’d turned Tomo down, why she’d lied, but the words wouldn’t come.</p>
      <p>When they reached that tree, Yumi stopped, her gaze fixed on the branches above. “Do you remember the promise we made here?”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her throat tight. “Of course I do.”</p>
      <p>Yumi smiled faintly, her eyes distant. “Sometimes I wonder if we’ve kept it. If we’re still the people we were back then.”</p>
      <p>Aya looked at her, the weight of unspoken words pressing down on her chest. “Maybe we’re not. But maybe that’s okay.”</p>
      <p>Yumi turned to her, her gaze soft but searching. “Do you think things would’ve been different if we’d stayed in touch?”</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, her heart pounding. “I don’t know. Maybe.”</p>
      <p>The silence that followed was thick with unspoken truths, the weight of their shared history pressing down on them. Aya wanted to reach out, to bridge the distance between them, but fear held her back.</p>
      <p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in shades of gold and amber, Yumi stepped closer, her voice barely a whisper. </p>
      <p>“I’m glad you came back, Aya.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s breath hitched, her chest aching with a longing she couldn’t name. “Me too.”</p>
       <p>And for a moment, it felt like the world had stilled, the only sound the gentle rustle of leaves above them.</p>
