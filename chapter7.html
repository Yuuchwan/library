      <h1>Chapter 7 - What the Heart Knows </h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Aya woke to the soft patter of rain against her window. The sky was a dull gray, and the familiar scent of wet earth filled the air. She wrapped a blanket around her shoulders and stared at the unfinished painting propped against the wall.</p>
      <p>The cherry tree stared back at her, incomplete but vibrant, the figures beneath its branches mere silhouettes. Aya had started adding color to the figures but hesitated every time, afraid of what completing them might mean.</p>
      <p>She sighed, her thoughts drifting to Yumi, as they so often did these days. Aya had thought she could keep her feelings contained, hidden beneath the surface of their friendship. But the cracks were showing, and every glance, every touch, felt like it was unraveling her carefully built facade.</p>
      <p>The rain was still falling when Aya found herself wandering toward the bookstore. The streets were mostly empty, the gray skies casting everything in a muted light. By the time she reached the door, her hair was damp, and her cheeks were flushed from the cold.</p>
      <p>Inside, Yumi was shelving books, her movements quick and practiced. She looked up as the bell above the door jingled, a smile spreading across her face.</p>
      <p>“Aya. What are you doing out in this weather?”</p>
      <p>Aya shrugged, trying to keep her tone casual. “Needed to get out of the house.”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s gaze lingered on her for a moment before she nodded. “Well, you picked the perfect time. It’s dead in here today. Want some tea?”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, grateful for the warmth as Yumi disappeared into the back room. She wandered through the aisles, running her fingers along the spines of the books. The store felt cozy, a refuge from the storm outside.</p>
      <p>When Yumi returned with two steaming mugs, she gestured for Aya to join her at the small table by the window. They sat in comfortable silence for a while, the sound of rain filling the gaps between them.</p>
      <p>“You’ve been quiet lately,” Yumi said finally, her tone light but probing. “Is everything okay?”</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, her fingers tightening around the mug. “I guess I’ve just been thinking a lot.”</p>
      <p>“About what?”</p>
      <p>Aya looked out the window, her thoughts swirling. She wanted to tell Yumi everything—the confusion, the longing, the fear—but the words felt too heavy.</p>
      <p>“About us,” she said softly, her voice barely audible over the rain.</p>
      <p>Yumi blinked, her expression caught between curiosity and surprise. “Us?”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her heart pounding. “Do you ever feel like… like things are different now? Like we’re not the same people we were when we made that promise?”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s gaze softened, her fingers tracing the rim of her mug. “I think we’ve both changed. But I don’t think that’s a bad thing.”</p>
      <p>Aya looked at her, searching for something in her expression. “Do you ever wonder what it would’ve been like if we hadn’t lost touch?”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s lips parted as if to answer, but the sound of the bell above the door interrupted her. Aya turned to see Tomo stepping inside, his umbrella dripping rain onto the floor.</p>
      <p>“Yumi,” he said, his smile bright despite the dreary weather. “I thought I’d stop by. I figured you’d be stuck inside with this rain.”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s smile faltered for a split second before she recovered. “Hey, Tomo. What brings you here?”</p>
      <p>“Just wanted to see you,” he said, his gaze flickering to Aya. “And Aya, too, apparently.”</p>
      <p>Aya forced a polite nod, her chest tightening. She could feel the shift in the room, the unspoken tension that seemed to settle over them.</p>
      <p>“I was just about to close up,” Yumi said, standing and gathering their empty mugs. “But you’re welcome to hang out for a bit.”</p>
      <p>Tomo nodded, pulling a book from a nearby shelf and settling into one of the chairs. Aya watched him, her thoughts a whirlwind of jealousy and self-reproach.</p>
      <p>As the rain continued to fall, Aya felt the weight of her feelings pressing down on her. She wanted to leave, to escape the discomfort of watching Tomo so easily take up space in Yumi’s life. But she couldn’t bring herself to move.</p>
      <p>When the clock struck six, Yumi announced that it was time to close. Tomo lingered by the door, chatting with Yumi about plans for the weekend. Aya stayed back, her hands shoved deep into her pockets.</p>
      <p>As they stepped outside, the rain had slowed to a drizzle. Tomo said his goodbyes and disappeared down the street, leaving Aya and Yumi alone under the dim glow of the streetlights.</p>
      <p>Yumi turned to Aya, her expression unreadable. </p>
      <p>“You’ve been weird all day,” she said, her tone light but edged with concern. “What’s going on?”
      </p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, the words on the tip of her tongue. She wanted to tell Yumi everything, but the fear of ruining what they had held her back.</p>
      <p>“It’s nothing,” she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
      <p>Yumi studied her for a moment before sighing. “You’re a terrible liar, Aya.”</p>
      <p>Aya managed a weak smile, her chest aching. “I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”</p>
      <p>Yumi nodded, her eyes lingering on Aya as she turned and walked away. The distance between them felt heavier than it ever had, and Aya wondered if it was a gap they could ever truly bridge.</p>
