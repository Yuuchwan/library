      <h1>Aya's POV </h1>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>From the very start, Aya is portrayed as a mature, self-aware individual. She has a quiet intensity, and although her emotional side is often hidden behind a calm exterior, it’s constantly at war with her practical, logical nature. Her perspective on love is complicated by her past experiences—especially her complicated relationship with her father and the emotional distance she often feels. Yet her bond with Yumi is the exception. Her emotions are the one place where she can’t quite keep control. Aya is deeply aware of her feelings for Yumi, but she’s also afraid of making them known, terrified of what it might mean to finally face the truth. This tension is central to her emotional journey.</strong></p>
      <p>Aya's memory of their promise under the tree is bittersweet, colored by the pain of loss and the confusion of growing up. She’s an idealist at heart, despite how hardened life has made her. As she holds onto that promise—no matter how distant or unlikely it seems—there’s a quiet optimism that keeps her going. It’s not just a promise to Yumi, it’s a promise to herself: that one day, they would find their way back to each other.</p>
      <p>Aya’s internal voice is filled with wonder and a trace of sadness as she recalls the simplicity of that time. The way Yumi smiled at her, how easy it was to make a promise that felt so real at the time. The unspoken truth is that Aya knew, even then, that they shared something deeper than just friendship. She couldn’t put words to it, but the connection was undeniable.</p>
      <p>The years without Yumi are a blur of loneliness and uncertainty for Aya. Although she builds a successful life, the lack of emotional connection with her father and the absence of Yumi weigh on her. The distance from her family becomes more palpable as she grows older. She’s constantly trying to fill the void left by their separation, but nothing ever feels complete. Aya’s POV reveals how much she internalizes the pain of their separation—she keeps busy, keeps working, keeps painting—but she’s always asking herself whether Yumi remembers her, whether that promise meant anything.</p>
      <p>When she first sees Yumi again, it's like a jolt of electricity. Her heart races as memories flood her mind, and she feels that same spark, that same longing she’s never been able to suppress. But she’s also scared—scared that time has changed them both, that Yumi might not remember the connection the same way. Aya’s inner conflict is palpable: Should she reach out? Or should she let the past stay buried?</p>
      <p>Reconnecting with Yumi is a whirlwind for Aya. She’s guarded at first, unsure if it’s wise to reopen a chapter of her life that was never truly closed. Aya doesn’t speak openly about her emotions—she never has—but inside, she’s overwhelmed by the rawness of their reunion. Every conversation with Yumi feels like it’s pulling her in deeper, but Aya is hesitant to take the plunge. She doesn’t want to be the one to change everything, to risk everything for something that might not be the same. She watches Yumi closely, analyzing her every word and gesture, hoping for a clue, a signal that Yumi might feel the same way.</p>
      <p>Her feelings for Yumi are a constant undercurrent. As much as she wants to remain rational and unaffected, Aya can’t escape the emotional intensity of seeing Yumi again. Her feelings are too strong, and the more time they spend together, the more she realizes how much she’s missed Yumi—not just as a friend, but as someone who made her feel seen, understood, and loved in a way no one else ever could.</p>
      <p>On the one hand, she feels like she’s been given a second chance to be close to Yumi. But on the other hand, she’s aware of the emotional baggage they both carry. Aya is keenly aware of how much they’ve both changed, and she doesn’t want to impose her feelings on Yumi.It’s clear that Yumi is still grappling with her own emotions, especially when it comes to her family’s expectations.</p>
      <p>Aya begins to feel the weight of unspoken words. She knows that telling Yumi how she feels would change everything, and the thought terrifies her. So, she keeps it to herself, hiding behind her artwork and her carefully constructed walls. She wants to let Yumi come to her, wants Yumi to see her without needing to voice it.</p>
      <p>But as Yumi starts to distance herself, Aya feels a fear she hasn’t felt in years—fear of losing Yumi again. This chapter marks the beginning of Aya’s emotional vulnerability, even if she doesn’t show it outwardly.</p>
      <p>Aya can see that Yumi is struggling with something deeper—something she hasn’t shared with her. She watches Yumi carefully, noting the little signs: the way she withdraws at times, the hesitations in her voice, and the uncertainty in her eyes. Aya knows Yumi well enough to understand that there’s something more going on, but Yumi hasn’t opened up about it yet.
    </p>
      <p>As Aya learns about Yumi’s situation—especially her complicated relationship with Tomo—there’s a deep sense of empathy for her friend. Aya doesn’t want to push Yumi, but she can’t help but feel frustrated that Yumi is so torn. Aya’s protective instinct flares, but she doesn’t know how to help without crossing a boundary.</p>
      <p>The truth she’s hidden from herself and from Yumi is no longer something she can ignore. Aya realizes she’s in love with Yumi. It’s a realization that stirs up both relief and fear. The relief comes from finally acknowledging her feelings; the fear comes from not knowing what to do with that truth. Aya is paralyzed by the potential consequences of confessing, particularly knowing how complicated Yumi’s life is.</p>
      <p>She loves Yumi, but she’s unsure whether Yumi is capable of reciprocating that love—especially with everything going on in her life. Aya is torn between wanting to protect Yumi from the complexities of her feelings and desiring to be honest and open.</p>
      <p>t’s not an immediate decision, but one she comes to after realizing that keeping her feelings to herself isn’t helping either of them. She begins to take small steps toward being more open with Yumi, not just about her feelings but also about her own emotional needs. There’s a sense of quiet resolution in her thoughts, a recognition that love doesn’t always fit into neat, comfortable boxes.</p>
        <p>Even though she hasn’t openly confessed her feelings, there’s a deep emotional understanding between her and Yumi. Aya begins to realize that sometimes, love doesn’t require grand declarations. Instead, it’s about being there, being present, and respecting the other person’s pace. Her journey culminates in the realization that, whether or not Yumi can fully return her love, Aya is at peace with the bond they share.</p>
        <p>She has learned to accept both herself and the complexity of her relationship with Yumi. While they haven’t declared their love out loud, Aya has come to understand that their connection is enough.</p>
        <p>It’s a quiet, enduring love—one that doesn’t need a label or grand statement to be real.</p>
