      <h1>Chapter 9 - Fractures and Truths</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Aya didn’t return Yumi’s calls or messages for days. She buried herself in her art, her brush moving across the canvas with a desperation she didn’t fully understand. The oak tree had come to life in vivid detail, its branches stretching wide, casting shadows over the figures beneath it.</p>
      <p>The two silhouettes were no longer faceless—they had become Aya and Yumi, standing under the tree as they had so many years ago. Aya hesitated as she added the final touches, her hand trembling as she painted the faint pink hue of blossoms that shouldn’t exist in winter.</p>
      <p>When she finally stepped back, the painting seemed to look back at her, its silence echoing the turmoil in her chest.</p>
      <p>Her father’s voice startled her out of her thoughts. “Aya?”</p>
      <p>She turned to see him standing in the doorway, his expression unreadable. “You’ve been locked in here for days. Is everything okay?”</p>
      <p>Aya looked at him, searching for the right words. “I’m fine. Just… working.”</p>
      <p>He stepped closer, his gaze shifting to the painting. “That’s the tree, isn’t it? The one from our old neighborhood?”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her throat tight.</p>
      <p>Her father studied the painting for a moment before speaking again. “You’ve been different since you reconnected with Yumi.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s stomach twisted. “It’s nothing,” she said quickly.</p>
      <p>He frowned, his gaze softening. “Aya, I’m your father. I might not always say the right things, but I can tell when something’s bothering you.”</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, the weight of her feelings pressing down on her. She wanted to confide in him, to say the words she couldn’t bring herself to say to Yumi. But the fear of rejection held her back.</p>
      <p>“It’s complicated,” she said finally.</p>
      <p>He nodded, his expression thoughtful. “Sometimes the things that matter most are.”</p>
      <p>His words lingered long after he left, echoing in Aya’s mind as she stared at the painting.</p>
      <p>The next day, Aya found herself standing outside the bookstore, her heart pounding. She hadn’t planned to come, but her feet had carried her there before she could stop herself.</p>
      <p>The bell above the door jingled as she stepped inside. Yumi was behind the counter, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw Aya.</p>
      <p>“Aya,” she said, her voice soft. “You’re here.”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her throat tight. “Can we talk?”</p>
      <p>Yumi hesitated before nodding, gesturing for Aya to follow her into the back room. The small space was cluttered with books and boxes, but it felt private, secluded from the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>“What’s going on?” Yumi asked, her tone cautious.</p>
      <p>Aya took a deep breath, her hands trembling. “I’ve been avoiding you, and I’m sorry. It’s not fair to you.”</p>
      <p>Yumi crossed her arms, her gaze steady. “Why have you been avoiding me?”</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, the words tangled in her throat. She could feel the weight of everything she’d left unsaid pressing down on her, threatening to overwhelm her.</p>
      <p>“Because I don’t know how to deal with this,” she admitted, her voice breaking.</p>
      <p>Yumi frowned. “Deal with what?”</p>
      <p>Aya looked at her, the fear and longing in her chest colliding. “With you. With how I feel about you.”</p>
      <p>The room fell silent, the weight of Aya’s confession hanging in the air. Yumi’s eyes widened, her lips parting as if to speak, but no words came.</p>
      <p>Aya took a step back, panic rising in her chest. “I shouldn’t have said that. I’m sorry—”</p>
      <p>“Aya” Yumi said, her voice firm.</p>
      <p>Aya froze, her heart pounding.</p>
      <p>Yumi stepped closer, her gaze searching Aya’s face. “Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”</p>
      <p>Aya laughed bitterly, the sound hollow. “Because I was afraid. Afraid of ruining what we have. Afraid of losing you.”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s expression softened, but there was something unreadable in her eyes. </p>
      <p>“You never lost me, Aya. But I don’t know what to do with this—what you just said.”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her chest aching. “I don’t expect you to. I just… I needed you to know.”</p>
      <p>The silence that followed was deafening. Aya felt the tears welling in her eyes, and before Yumi could say anything else, she turned and walked out.</p>
      <p>That night, Aya sat under the cherry tree, the cold biting at her skin. She stared up at the branches, her breath forming clouds in the air.</p>
      <p>She thought of their promise, of the years they’d spent apart, of the fragile bond they’d rebuilt. And she wondered if she’d just destroyed it all.</p>
      <p>When Yumi found her, hours later, Aya didn’t look up. She didn’t trust herself to speak.</p>
      <p>Yumi sat beside her, the silence stretching between them. Finally, she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
      <p>“Do you remember what you said back then? When we made that promise?”</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her throat tight. “I said we’d figure out who we were.”</p>
      <p>“And have you?” Yumi asked, her gaze fixed on the tree.</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, the weight of the question pressing down on her.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know. But I know how I feel about you. And that’s enough for me.”</p>
      <p>Yumi looked at her, her eyes shining with something Aya couldn’t quite place.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what to say, Aya. I don’t know what I feel.”</p>
      <p>Aya managed a weak smile, her chest aching.</p>
      <p>“You don’t have to say anything. Just… don’t leave. Not again.”</p>
      <p>Yumi nodded, her hand brushing against Aya’s. They sat in silence, the cold forgotten as the first stars began to appear in the sky.</p>
      <p>And for the first time in weeks, Aya felt a sliver of hope.</p>
