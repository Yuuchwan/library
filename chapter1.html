      <h1>Chapter 1 - The Cherry Blossom Promise</h1>
      <hr> <p>Aya’s breath caught as she stood in front of the bookstore. She hadn’t been back to this small town in seven years, not since she left for art school and vowed never to return. Yet here she was, her suitcase still at her father’s house, her feet rooted to the sidewalk. Through the large glass window, she could see Yumi behind the counter, her dark hair pulled back as she organized a pile of books.</p>
      <p>For a moment, Aya debated turning around and pretending she’d never come. The years had made them strangers, hadn’t they? But something deeper—the memory of a childhood promise—pulled her forward.</p>
      <p>The door chimed softly as Aya stepped inside, and Yumi looked up. Their eyes met, and the world seemed to hold its breath.</p>
      <p>“Aya?” Yumi’s voice was soft, hesitant, as if she didn’t trust what she was seeing.</p>
      <p>Aya nodded, her own voice caught in her throat. “Hey, Yumi.”</p>
      <p>The space between them felt heavy with time and unspoken words. Seven years. Seven long years.</p>
      <p>Yumi stepped out from behind the counter, her movements careful, almost as though she were afraid Aya might vanish if she moved too quickly.</p>
      <p>“You’re back,” she said simply, her tone a mix of surprise and warmth.</p>
      <p>Aya managed a small smile. “I am. Just for a little while. I… wasn’t expecting to see you here.”</p>
      <p>“Me neither,” Yumi admitted, brushing her hands against her apron. “But it’s… good to see you.”</p>
      <p>They stood in awkward silence, the weight of their past hovering between them. Aya shifted uncomfortably, her fingers brushing against the strap of her bag.</p>
      <p>“Do you have time to catch up? Maybe over coffee?”</p>
      <p>Yumi’s expression softened. “Sure. There’s a café just down the street. Let me grab my coat.”</p>
      <p>As they walked through the familiar streets, Aya couldn’t stop glancing at Yumi. She’d grown into herself over the years—more composed, more confident—but there were still traces of the girl Aya had known. The same quiet kindness, the same thoughtful way she spoke.</p>
      <p>At the café, they chose a corner table by the window. Their conversation started slow, skimming over the years they’d missed. Yumi shared stories of her life in the town, running the bookstore with her family, while Aya spoke about her travels and career as an artist.</p>
      <p>But no matter how much they talked, there was one memory that neither could ignore.</p>
      <p>“Do you ever think about the old days?” Yumi asked suddenly, her fingers curling around her mug.</p>
      <p>Aya hesitated, then nodded. “All the time. Especially the cherry tree.”</p>
      <p>Yumi smiled faintly. “That tree. I haven’t been there in years.”</p>
      <p>Aya’s chest tightened. “Do you remember what we said there? That last day before I left?”</p>
      <p>Yumi looked down at her mug, her expression thoughtful. “Of course, I remember.”</p>
      <p>It was summer. The tree stood tall in the park, its branches heavy with blossoms that fluttered in the warm breeze. They had sat beneath its shade, their legs stretched out in the grass, knowing it would be one of their last days together.</p>
      <p>Aya had sat up suddenly, her expression serious.</p>
      <p>“Let’s make a promise,” she’d said, her voice filled with determination. </p>
      <p>“No matter where we go or what happens, let’s meet here again. When we’re older.”</p>
      <p>Yumi had hesitated, biting her lip. “How old?”</p>
      <p>Aya had shrugged, the sunlight catching her glasses and making her smile seem brighter.</p>
      <p>“Old enough to figure out who we are.”</p>
      <p>Yumi had laughed softly, her heart feeling strangely full. “Okay. I promise.”</p>
      <p>They had hooked pinkies under the tree, the blossoms above them fluttering like a blessing, sealing their vow with the innocence only children could have.</p>
      <p>Now, sitting across from Yumi, Aya could still feel the weight of that promise. She didn’t know if either of them had truly figured out who they were, but here they were—older, different, yet somehow still connected.</p>
      <p>“I thought about that promise a lot,” Aya admitted quietly.</p>
      <p>Yumi looked up at her, something unspoken flickering in her eyes. “Me too.”</p>
      <p>The conversation drifted back to lighter topics after that, but the memory of their promise lingered. When they finally parted ways outside the café, Aya couldn’t help but glance over her shoulder as Yumi walked back to the bookstore.</p>
      <p>The years had changed them, but the pull between them was still there, as undeniable as the breeze that rustled the leaves of the old oak tree.</p>
      <p>And for the first time in a long time, Aya wondered if coming back home wasn’t just about finding her roots—it was about finding Yumi again.</p>
